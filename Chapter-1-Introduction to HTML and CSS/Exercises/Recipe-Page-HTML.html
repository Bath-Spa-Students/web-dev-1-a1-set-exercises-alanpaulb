    <h1> Jalebi </h1>

<p> Jalebi is a popular sweet snack in South Asia, the Middle East, Africa and Mauritius. It goes by many names, including jilapi, zelepi, jilebi, jilipi, zulbia, jerry, mushabak, zâ€™labia, zengoula or zalabia </p>

<h1> Ingredients of Jalebi </h1>

<p> 3. cup all purpose flour </p>
<p> 2. cup hung curd </p>
<p>1/2 cup ghee </p>
<p>3 cup sugar</p>
<p>5 strand saffron</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon powdered green cardamom </p>
<p>2 cup corn flour</p>
<p>1 1/2 pinch baking soda </p>
<p> cup sunflower oil</p>
<p>3 cup water</p>
<p>4 drops rose essence</p>
<p>1/2 teaspoon edible food color</p>

<h1> How to Prepare </h1>

<h2> Step 1  Prepare the Jalebi batter and let it ferment overnight </h2>

<p> To make this easy Jalebi recipe, mix together all-purpose flour, cornflour and baking soda in a bowl. Now,
add ghee and food colour to the above mixture and give a mix.
To make a thick batter add hung curd and water.
Mix well until it is thick but has a slightly flowing consistency.
Keep it aside for 8-10 hours to ferment. This step is important to give that unique "khatta" taste to Jalebi.
To make the sugar syrup, heat water in a pan over medium flame.
Add sugar and mix until fully dissolved. Simmer the syrup until it attains one-string consistency.
Add saffron, cardamom powder and rose essence. Stir well to prepare the final sugar syrup.
This will be used to soak the jalebis and give them their signature sweetness.</p>


<h2> Step 2   Deep fry the Jalebis </h2>

<p> Now, heat oil in a pan over medium flame for deep frying. 
Fill the jalebi batter in a muslin cloth and pierce a small hole in
the cloth. You can even use a squeezy bottle (ketchup bottles with
a small nozzle on top) to make jalebis. Now just squeeze the muslin
cloth to make concentric circles. Move from inside to outside to 
make perfect circles. Fry till jalebis from both the sides until
they are crispy in texture and golden in colour. </p>


<h2> Step 3 Soak the Jalebis in sugar syrup and serve </h2>

<p> Soak the jalebis in sugar syrup for 3-4 minutes in warm sugar syrup.
Ensure that the sugar syrup is warm and not very hot, 
as this will make the jalebis limp. Don't soak the jalebis for
too long if you wish to retain their crispiness. Now, remove the 
jalebis from the syrup and place it on a tray lined with butter 
paper or foil. Decorate with silver foil (optional) and serve the
jalebis hot, warm or at room temperature with creamy Rabri.
Note: To make the jalebi even more delicious, add a little bit 
of ghee to the batter, this will give your jalebi that perfect
aroma. To the crispy Jalebi, don't forget to ferment the batter 
overnight. </p>
